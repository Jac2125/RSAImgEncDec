# RSAImgEncDec
Encrypting/Decrypting an image using RSA algorithm

# What's happening?
---
The program will decompose a given image into [R,G,B] format and encrypt each three value with public key.
The user will be able to decrypt an npy file with a private key generated by the program and saved in mysql localhost server.

Once two prime numbers p and q are generated, the program stores the private key and further information into mysql server.

A file whose name is randomly generated with given file length will contain the encrypted image RGB information and be saved in ./encArrays

The program implements various algorithms including Rabin-Miller Primality test, modulus calculation for huge number, Fermat's little theorem, etc.

# Needs to imporve on...
---
When there is a duplicative value while encrypting/decrypting numbers, why not replacing the number?
  EX) Store each R,G,B value paired with enrypted number in hash table or vice versa, search up the key value if exist, and insert the value paired with key.
